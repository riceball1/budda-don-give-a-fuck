A page of serious buddha shit quotes

## Why did I make this crap? 

Well you know there are days when people just think about random shit and then go, "why the fuck not?" And welp, here's an example of one of those by-products of a mind that just keeps churning nothing but random ass ideas.

I think as I was coming up with this idea as I was chatting with a friend online, this made me laugh. And who doesn't want to laugh, except the most deranged folks?

Sometimes there are those feel good quotes like "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade" and it's all nice and fluffy, but ~ vomit ~ much? I think that it's not all digestible content for everyone, so for those of us who have been beaten down and found llife to be full of toe stubbing obstacles, we need a bit more sharp humor to kind of poke at our cynical, dead-inside kind of souls. Thus, this site was created, providing the type of dark, yet fun-loving humor we zombies need and want to love-but-can't-because-we-have-been-jaded-the-fuck-out-by-all-the-gosh-darn-lemons-this-world-has-dumped-on-us. 

In conclusion, hope you all enjoy this little small project, as I develop it further, maybe make it less of a lazy static site, but turn it into something more alive and bouncy. Til next time!
